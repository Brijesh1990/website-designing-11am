Why Use Sass?

Stylesheets are getting larger, more complex, and harder to maintain. This is where a CSS pre-processor can help.

Sass lets you use features that do not exist in CSS, like variables, nested rules, mixins, imports, inheritance, built-in functions, and other stuff.

Sass is used to load on server side or executed on server side 
Sass provides many features to load variables.

examples:  style.scss

         $bg-success: green;
         $bg-danger:red;
         $bg-white:white;
         
         $text-success: green;
         $text-danger:red;
         $text-white:white;

How Does Sass Work?

A browser does not understand Sass code. Therefore, you will need a Sass pre-processor to convert Sass code into standard CSS.

This process is called transpiling. So, you need to give a transpiler (some kind of program) some Sass code and then get some CSS code back.


Tip: Transpiling is a term for taking a source code written in one language and transform/translate it into another language.
